# Decentralized Voting App

## TODO: Add the build process for building the hardhat portion of the project. 

## Build the frontend
1. Clone this repo.
2. `cd` into this directory.
3. `npm install` to install necessary `NPM` dependencies. 
4. `cd client` into the client portion of the application to build the frontend.
5. Run another `npm install` inside of the `client` directory to install the dependencies for React.
6. After installing the packages, run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
7. Go to either the `Local` or `Network` address for the development server. `Local` is local to the machine but `Network` is available to any device on your LAN.

The development server is a live server so it will change in real time as changes are made which is good for debugging.
